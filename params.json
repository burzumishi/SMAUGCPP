{"name":"Smaugcpp","tagline":"SMAUG C++","body":"SMAUG C++\r\n=========\r\n\r\n**Smaug** is the base code that runs the popular **[Realms of Despair] (http://www.realmsofdespair.com)** MUD. Through the years it has been tweaked, modified, and enhanced to become one of the most feature packed branches of the **MERC** family of codebases. \r\n\r\nThe ongoing goal of **Smaug C++** is to find and eliminate as many of the bugs in the stock **Smaug** source code as possible so as to provide for a clean, stable base for new admins to run a **Smaug** mud from. \r\n\r\n**Smaug C++** has evolved to become a very solid, stable, and feature packed member of the **MERC** family. Through continued efforts to modernize and enhance the code, we hope to carry Smaug into the future as THE choice for a MUD codebase.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
